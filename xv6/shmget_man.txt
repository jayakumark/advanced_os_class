NAME
	shmget - allocates a shared memory segment

SYNOPSIS
	int shmget(uint token, char * addr, uint size);

	if this region overlaps with a region used for 
	any other purpose the use is undefined

DESCRIPTION
	shmget() returns -1 on failure, returns 0 on success.
	On success shmget() creates a shared memory segment
	in the calling process, allocating at least one page.
	addr must be a page aligned virtual address; size is
	the number of bytes the user wants to share.  If size
	is less than a page, a page will be allocated; pages
	allocated will be size rounded up to the nearest number
	of pages.	
	
	If the user wants to share a memory segment already set
	up by another process, call shmget with the correct token
	and a size of zero.  

	When a new shared memory segment is created, its contents
	are initialized to zero values.
